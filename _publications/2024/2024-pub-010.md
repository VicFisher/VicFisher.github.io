  MeSiteIG, a geometric deep learning tool, enables metal-binding site identification and grafting using E3-equivariant graph neural networks, achieving high accuracy and speed (~300 samples/second) in predicting metal-binding residues, identifying overlooked protein metal-binding sites, and designing novel metalloproteins by grafting metal sites onto antibodies and protein pockets.
