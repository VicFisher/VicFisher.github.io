  PhoreGen, a novel pharmacophore-oriented 3D molecular generation method, uses asynchronous updates and message-passing to integrate ligand-pharmacophore mapping, producing chemically reasonable, diverse, and drug-like molecules with high binding affinity. It successfully identified new bicyclic boronate inhibitors for metallo- and serine-β-lactamases and first-in-class covalent inhibitors for metallo-nicotinamidases, demonstrating its potential for feature-customized drug discovery.
