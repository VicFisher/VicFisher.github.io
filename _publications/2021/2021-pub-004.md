abstract: >-
  A series of 3-aryl substituted benzoxaborole derivatives were developed as broad-spectrum inhibitors of serine- and metallo-β-lactamases, with compound 9f showing potent inhibition (IC50 of 86 nM for KPC-2) and significantly reducing meropenem MICs in resistant bacterial strains without toxicity in HEK293T cells.
